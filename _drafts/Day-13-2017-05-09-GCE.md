Adrian Cockcroft former cloud architect who made micro services mainstream

from Net Flix

make monolithic system into chunks


reason that using microservice is speeding up development
breaking it into micro services is really about freeing up everybody to run at their own speed


each system don't coordinate each other.
If you coordinate them yor're going back to the monolith!

the point really is to let everybody release on their own cycle.
which means you need to make sure hat the interfaces are relatively stable and
you can deploy any piece of it independently of any other piece.
Typically without sort of asking permission but you Typically let people know.

need automation for testing or documentation.


They just let other systems know. -> need more time for interface and documention

-> It help to dev team to release faster.
